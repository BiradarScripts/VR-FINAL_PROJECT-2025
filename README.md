# 🧠📷 Multimodal Visual Question Answering with ABO Dataset

---

## 🗂️ Project Overview

This project leverages the extensive **Amazon Berkeley Objects (ABO)** dataset to build a powerful **Multimodal Visual Question Answering (VQA)** system.

### 🔍 Objectives:
- 🎯 **Dataset Augmentation**: Create a multiple-choice VQA dataset from ABO using **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**.
- 🔧 **Baseline Modeling**: Establish robust baseline models and systematically evaluate them.
- 📈 **Performance Boost**: Fine-tune models to significantly enhance their accuracy and generalization.
- 🤖 **End Goal**: Develop a high-performing model capable of understanding visual data and accurately answering related questions.
